  funFact: "Amano Shrimp are the undisputed algae-eating champions of freshwater aquariums! Named after legendary aquascaper Takashi Amano (who popularized them in the 1980s), a single Amano can consume significant amounts of algae daily. Watch them work with their tiny fan-like hands, constantly shoveling food into their mouths. They molt (shed their shell) every 3-8 weeks—don't panic when you find the empty translucent shell, it's not a dead shrimp!",

Dense planting provides security during molting when they\'re vulnerable. Moderate water flow is appreciated—they naturally live in flowing streams.',

    description: 'Amano Shrimp are tireless cleaners, constantly moving and grazing. They\'re more active than Cherry Shrimp, always exploring and climbing every surface. Watch them "sweep" with their fan-like maxillipeds (feeding hands), rapidly shoveling detritus and algae. They\'re bold and work in daylight, climbing glass and marching across plants. Peaceful but assertive, they\'ll steal food from slower shrimp without aggression. Social in groups of 5+, they often graze together. Females carrying eggs (visible green saddle) are especially active foragers.',

    proTips: [
      "Amanos excel at eating soft green algae and hair algae. 5-10 Amanos can clear a 100L tank in 2-3 weeks. They ignore brown diatoms and black beard algae.",
      "Supplement their diet! Once algae is depleted, feed blanched zucchini, spinach, algae wafers, or shrimp pellets 2-3x per week. Starving shrimp become lethargic.",
      "Molting happens every 3-8 weeks. The empty shell looks like a dead shrimp. Don't remove it—shrimp eat their old shells to recycle calcium. Count your shrimp to confirm.",
      "Drip-acclimation is critical. Use airline tubing with a valve to slowly match tank parameters over 2+ hours. Sudden changes cause osmotic shock and failed molts.",
      "Amanos can climb out of tanks. They'll climb airline tubing, filter pipes, and even wet glass. Always use a lid with no gaps.",
      "Ensure adequate calcium (GH 6+) for healthy molting. If water is soft, add crushed coral, cuttlebone, or mineral supplements. Soft shells lead to molting deaths.",
    ],
    commonMistakes: [
      "Not feeding after algae is gone. Amanos are so efficient they eliminate their food source. Supplement with vegetables and pellets or they'll starve.",
      "Using copper-containing products. Many fertilizers, medications, and tap water (copper pipes) contain copper. It's 100% fatal to invertebrates. Check all labels.",
      "Rapid acclimation kills shrimp. Drip-acclimate for minimum 2 hours to slowly match temperature, pH, and GH. Dumping them in causes osmotic shock.",
      "Expecting reproduction. Amanos cannot breed in freshwater. Females carry eggs, but larvae need brackish water. All aquarium Amanos are wild-caught or farm-raised.",
      "Mistaking molts for deaths. Empty shells are identical to dead shrimp. Wait 24 hours and count your shrimp before panicking.",
      "Keeping water too warm. Above 27°C causes stress and shortened lifespan. They prefer cooler temperatures (22-25°C).",

  scientificContext: {
    wildHabitat: "Amano Shrimp inhabit fast-flowing mountain streams and rivers in Japan and Taiwan. Adults live in freshwater with high oxygen levels and strong current. They're amphidromous—larvae require brackish water (estuaries) to develop. Females carry 1,000-3,000 eggs and naturally migrate downstream to release larvae in brackish estuaries. Larvae drift for 4-6 weeks feeding on phytoplankton before metamorphosing into juveniles that migrate back upstream to freshwater.",
    sexualDimorphism: "Females are larger (4-5cm) with elongated lower pleopods for egg-carrying. When gravid, they display a bright green or brown saddle (egg mass) visible through their translucent shell. Males are smaller (3-4cm), slimmer, and lack the saddle. Females have longer second pleopods. In groups, size difference is obvious.",

  breeding: {
    method: 'other',
    difficulty: 'expert',
    trigger: 'Breeding Amano Shrimp is extremely difficult for hobbyists. Females carry eggs in freshwater (visible green saddle), but larvae require brackish water (salinity 1.024, 35 ppt) to survive. Requirements: 1) Gravid females, 2) Separate brackish tank, 3) Algae-covered surfaces for larvae, 4) 6-8 weeks larval care in saltwater, 5) Gradual freshwater transition after metamorphosis. Larvae are microscopic and eat diatoms/phytoplankton. Most attempts fail due to larval mortality.',
    fryCare: 'Females release 1,000-3,000 microscopic larvae (zoea) that must immediately transfer to brackish water. Larvae are free-swimming filter-feeders requiring algae on tank walls—they cannot eat standard foods. After 4-6 weeks, they metamorphose into 2mm juveniles and need slow acclimation (1-2 weeks) back to freshwater. Survival rate is <5% even for experts. Commercial breeding uses hormone synchronization.',
    notes: 'Nearly all Amanos sold are wild-caught from Japan/Taiwan or commercially farmed. Home breeding is extremely difficult and not economically viable. If females drop eggs in freshwater, larvae die within 24 hours—they need saltwater. Enjoy watching gravid females, but don\'t expect reproduction. This complex lifecycle is why Amanos cost more than easily-bred Cherry Shrimp.',
