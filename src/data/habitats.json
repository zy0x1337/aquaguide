    "description": "For half the year, the Amazon River floods the surrounding jungle. Fish literally swim between tree trunks and falling leaves. The water is tea-brown as decaying foliage releases tannins. This makes the water extremely soft and acidic, leaving bacteria with almost no chance to survive.",
    "conditions": {
      "temperature": "24°C - 30°C (Warm)",
      "waterType": "Extremely soft & acidic (pH 4.5 - 6.5)",
      "flow": "Low to moderate flow",
      "visibility": "Low (turbid due to tannins)"
    },
    "ecology": "The dark coloration of the water provides small fish with protection from predators. Falling insects and the fine microfauna in the leaf litter form the primary food source. Plants hardly grow here, as the dark water allows very little light to penetrate.",

    "description": "Lake Tanganyika in East Africa is the second oldest freshwater lake on Earth. Its rocky coasts drop steeply and offer countless crevices and caves inhabited by highly specialized cichlids.",

      "flow": "Surface movement, but calm inside caves",
