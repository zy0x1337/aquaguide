    "description": "The Rio Negro is the largest blackwater river in the world. During the annual flood pulse, the water rises up to 15 meters, flooding the surrounding rainforest (Igapó). The water is stained a deep tea-brown by humic and tannic acids released from miles of decaying forest litter.
